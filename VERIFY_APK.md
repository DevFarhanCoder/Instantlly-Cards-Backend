# üîç VERIFY YOUR APK VERSION

## Check APK Details

### On Your Phone:

1. **Open the Instantlly app**
2. **Look at the bottom of the login screen or settings**
3. **Do you see a version number?**

### If you see version info:
- What version does it show? (e.g., 1.0.13, 1.0.0, etc.)

### If you DON'T see version:
1. Long-press the app icon
2. Tap "App info" (‚ÑπÔ∏è)
3. Look for "Version" or "App details"

## üö® CRITICAL TEST

### Do this RIGHT NOW on your phone:

1. **Force close the Instantlly app** (swipe from recents)
2. **Reopen the app**
3. **As soon as it opens, immediately shake your phone hard**
4. **Do you see a menu popup?**

### If YES (you see menu):
- Take a screenshot
- Send it to me
- Tell me what options you see in the menu

### If NO (no menu appears):
This means you're using a **PRODUCTION APK** (good!)

But the registration code still isn't running...

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

Based on the diagnostic results, I suspect the issue is one of these:

### Option 1: Wrong Build
You might have downloaded an old build. Let's verify:

**What's the file name of the APK you downloaded?**
- Should contain the build ID: `gMhyiCtiNaBqKtxLKpb9sC.apk`

### Option 2: Code Not in Build
The build might have been created before I added the notification code.

**When did you download the APK?**
- Today (Oct 6)?
- Yesterday?
- Earlier?

### Option 3: App Code Issue
There might be an error preventing the registration code from running.

**Need to check app logs via remote debugging (see GET_PHONE_LOGS.md)**

## üìû ANSWER THESE:

1. When you shake phone in app, do you see a menu? (YES/NO)
2. What's the APK filename you downloaded?
3. When did you download it? (date/time)
4. What version does the app show? (if visible)
5. Did you EVER see "Allow notifications" popup? (YES/NO)

Once I know these answers, I can pinpoint the exact issue!
