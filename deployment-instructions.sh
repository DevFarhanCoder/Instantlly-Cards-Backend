echo "🐛 LOOK FOR THESE LOG PATTERNS IN RENDER:"
echo "=========================================="
echo "🌐 [REQUEST] - Every API call with timestamp"
echo "📍 GET/POST paths and user agents"
echo "🔐 [AUTH CHECK] - Authentication attempts"
echo "✅ [AUTH SUCCESS] - Successful authentications"
echo "👤 User Info: Name and phone number"
echo "📱 [CONTACT FEED DEBUG] - Contact feed requests"
echo "📞 Found X contacts who are app users"
echo "📇 Found X total cards"
echo "⚡ Response times and query details"
echo ""
echo "🎯 WHAT TO CHECK:"
echo "=================="
echo "• If you see NO logs when using mobile app = App not calling API"
echo "• If you see [REQUEST] but no [AUTH CHECK] = Authentication middleware not reached"
echo "• If you see [AUTH CHECK] but no [AUTH SUCCESS] = Token/authentication issues"
echo "• If you see [AUTH SUCCESS] but no data = Database/query issues"
echo ""
echo "💡 The enhanced logging will show you EXACTLY where the issue is!"
